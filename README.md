## description

This is a webpage that allows a user to generate a SpaceX rocket based off of their personality trait.

## Usage

The user will enter their name and choose the personality trait that best decribes them from the choices provided.

Once the user does this, they will then click the Blast Off! button to generate their rocket.

The user will then be displayed a card that has the: - rocket name - rocket image - rocket info - number asteroids they may encounter on their way to mars

The user can then refresh the webpage back to original state by clicking the logo, or they can click Go Again! and keep their name saved and try out a different rocket.
